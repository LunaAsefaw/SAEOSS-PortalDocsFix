# SAEOSS-Portal

![SAEOSS_Logo](./img/SANSA_Logo.png)

## Overview
The SAEOSS-Portal has been proposed as a system of software components functioning together as the national central earth observation geospatial repository, with a view to metadata and open geospatial API standards compliance as well as user impact maximisation.

## key Consepts
Main focus of the platform (areas - admin -user and so on)

<!-- 
A **project** (dashboard) is the most important feature of GeoSight. Projects
combine different elements (Reference datasets, indicators, and context layers)
and enable data visualization/analysis for all end users. 

**Context layers** are geospatial layers used to contextualise the information
presented in a project.

**Indicators layers** derive from spreadsheets or other intelligence assets
harvested by the platform.

**Widgets** are visual components such as charts generated by performing data
analysis on country/regional levels and the indicator data. -->
