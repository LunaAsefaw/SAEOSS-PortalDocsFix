This section outlines the process of checking out the code for local development.

ðŸš© Make sure you have gone through the [Prerequisites Section](prerequisites.md) before following these notes.


Git Code check out  https://github.com/kartoza/SAEOSSS-Portal.git

```
git clone https://github.com/kartoza/SAEOSS-Portal.git

ðŸ“’**Which branch to use?** 
Note that we deploy our staging work from the `develop` branch and our production environment from the `main` branch. If you are planning on contributing improvements to the project, please submit them against the `develop` branch.

ðŸª§ Now that you have the code checked out, move on to the [IDE Setup](ide-setup.md) documentation.
