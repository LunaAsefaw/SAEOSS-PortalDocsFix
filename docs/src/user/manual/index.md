# User Manual

<!-- This is a manual for the user to be able to get a great understanding of what the platform does and how it works. Go into GREAT detail here. Guide entries should link to this -->

This section of the documentation describes every page in the application and
what the various components of that page do. The manual is intended to function
as a reference for the application. For narrative/workflow-based tutorials,
you may prefer to work through our [user guide](../guide/index.md).

1. [Home Page](home.md): This is the 'landing page' that you arrive on when you open the site.

The user manual aims to assist the user in learning the fundamentals of using the SAEOSS-portal platform. The goal of the documentation is to clear up any doubts or concerns related to workflows and will feature a page-by-page layout, making it easy for users to follow along.
