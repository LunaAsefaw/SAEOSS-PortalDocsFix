# Dashboard Page
Once a user has logged in, the dashboard page will be displayed. This is a central notification hub for communications from the SAEOSS-Portal platform.

The dashboard is broken into 4 main sections, namely:

   1. News Feed: The news feed provides a user with all the recent activity of the groups and organizations they follow.
   2. My Metadata Records: Displays all the metadata uploaded by the user.
   3. My Organization: Displays all metadata the user forms a part of.
   4. My Groups: Displays all the groups the user forms a part of.

#### Activity Button
The activity button allows you to filter the activity by organization, group, or dataset. This allows you to see individual activity on specific topics of interest.

### News Feed:
The news feed provides an overview of all recent activities of groups, organizations, or metadata you follow. This allows a user who is interested in a specific dataset/organization/group to be up to date with any new changes or assets in the system. Users can follow a group/organization/metadata dataset to receive these notifications. Learn more here: [Following datasets/groups/organizations](./metadata.md#following-datasets)
